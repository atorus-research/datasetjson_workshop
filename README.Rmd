## Description

Join us for an engaging workshop designed to introduce Dataset-JSON, a powerful format for sharing datasets. We'll start with an environment setup and explore the motivation behind choosing Dataset-JSON over other formats like Parquet. The session will include a detailed walkthrough of the Dataset-JSON specification, followed by
hands-on demonstrations and exercises in both R and Python.

Discover how to implement Dataset-JSON in your workflows, learn about upcoming adoption plans, and explore future roadmap and API integrations. This workshop is perfect for data professionals interested in improving dataset interoperability and sharing standards.

## Setup

ADD INFORMATION YOU WANT LEARNERS TO HAVE / STEPS THEY WANT THEM TO COMPLETE PRIOR TO THE WORKSHOP. THIS COULD BE A LINK TO A THREAD ON POSIT COMMUNITY, PACKAGE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS, HOW TO GET AN POSIT CLOUD ACCOUNT, ETC.
